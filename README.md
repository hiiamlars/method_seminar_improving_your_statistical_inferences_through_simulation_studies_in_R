# method_seminar_improving_your_statistical_inferences_through_simulation_studies_in_R

This repo contains all materials for the course "Improving the credibility of future research II: Improving your statistical inferences through simulation studies in R" as taught at the Unviersity of Bern in Spring Term 2025 as well as my self-created weekly documents and the final assignment.

This course uses Monte-Carlo simulation studies to teach participants to improve their statistical inferences. It is aimed at masters students in psychology.

All simulations are implemented in R using a specific workflow written in {tidyverse} and {purrr} that is designed to maximise ease of writing, interpreting, and reusing code - sometimes at the expense of the speed at which the code runs at. Researchers who are already familiar with writing simulations whose simulations may be more computationally intensive should consider implementing them in other dedicated packages such as {SimDesign} or {simhelpers}.

This repo is structured as follows: Besides this README the front page includes the Syllabus. Apart from that, each week (or the final assignment) has their own folder. Within these materials are divided as they are either *provided* by the seminar content or *created* as they have been somehow modified. Some folders include additional papers.
